# KnowledgeExtract Crew

Welcome to the **KnowledgeExtract Crew** project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a **multi-agent AI system** with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to **collaborate effectively** on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have **Python >=3.10 <3.14** installed on your system. Using a **virtual environment** is highly recommended to keep dependencies isolated.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Navigate to your project folder**  
   Open PowerShell and go to your project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "D:\knowledge_extract"
````

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   This creates a folder called `.venv` that contains a clean Python environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   On Windows, run:

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   > After activation, your terminal should show `(.venv)` at the beginning of the prompt.

4. **Install required dependencies**
   Install the packages needed for your project:

   ```bash
   pip install "crewai-tools==0.73.1" "chromadb==0.5.23"
   pip install crewai python-dotenv google-generativeai
   pip install crewai[tools] python-dotenv google-generativeai
   ```

5. **(Optional) Lock dependencies using crewAI CLI**
   This ensures everyone uses the same versions of all packages:

   ```bash
   crewai install
   ```

6. **Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

---

## Customizing Your Crew

1. **Configure agents**
   Edit `src/knowledge_extract/config/agents.yaml` to define your AI agents and their capabilities.

2. **Configure tasks**
   Edit `src/knowledge_extract/config/tasks.yaml` to define the tasks your agents should perform.

3. **Customize logic**
   Edit `src/knowledge_extract/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, or arguments for agents.

4. **Customize main inputs**
   Edit `src/knowledge_extract/main.py` to provide custom inputs to your agents and tasks.

---

## Running the Project

1. **Run the main module**
   Start the knowledge_extract Crew and execute the tasks:

   ```bash
   python -m src.knowledge_extract.main
   ```

2. **View the output**
   After execution, open the generated HTML file to see the results:

   ```powershell
   start output.html
   ```

   > This file contains the report/output generated by your AI agents.

3. **(Alternative) Run using crewAI CLI**
   From the root folder, you can also run:

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

   > This will assemble the crew, assign tasks as defined in the configuration, and generate a report (e.g., `report.md`).

## Understanding Your Crew

The **knowledge_extract Crew** is composed of multiple AI agents, each with **unique roles, goals, and tools**.

* Agents collaborate on tasks defined in `config/tasks.yaml`.
* `config/agents.yaml` outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent.
* The system leverages the collective skills of all agents to achieve complex objectives.
